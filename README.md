# Tennis Winnings Prediction Using Multiple Regression

# Project Overview
This project involves predicting tennis winnings using multiple regression analysis. The dataset used for this analysis is "tennis_stats.csv," which contains various features related to tennis player statistics. These features are utilized to build a multiple regression model to predict a player's winnings. [Check it out!](Tennis_Aces.ipynb)

## Dataset
The dataset, "tennis_stats.csv," consists of the following features:

* Player
* Year
* FirstServe
* FirstServePointsWon
* FirstServeReturnPointsWon
* SecondServePointsWon
* SecondServeReturnPointsWon
* Aces
* BreakPointsConverted
* BreakPointsFaced
* BreakPointsOpportunities
* BreakPointsSaved
* DoubleFaults
* ReturnGamesPlayed
* ReturnGamesWon
* ReturnPointsWon
* ServiceGamesPlayed
* ServiceGamesWon
* TotalPointsWon
* TotalServicePointsWon
* Wins
* Losses
* Winnings
* Ranking

## Project Goals
The main goals of this project are as follows:

To create a predictive model that can estimate a tennis player's winnings based on their statistics.
To identify which features have the most significant impact on a player's winnings.
To provide insights into the relationship between various player statistics and their winnings.

## How to Use the Code
Data Preparation: Before running the code, make sure to have the "tennis_stats.csv" dataset in the same directory as your code or specify the correct path to the dataset.

## Results
The project's results will include:

Predicted winnings for the tennis players in the dataset.
Model evaluation metrics (e.g., Mean Absolute Error, R-squared) to assess the model's performance.
Visualizations illustrating the relationships between different features and winnings.
Future Improvements
To enhance this project, consider the following future improvements:

## Collect more data to improve the accuracy of predictions.
Experiment with different regression algorithms and hyperparameter tuning for better model performance.
Incorporate additional features or external data sources to make more accurate predictions.
Develop a user-friendly web application or interface to allow users to input player statistics and obtain predicted winnings.
